This is a simple Sticky Note application that allows users to make notes, edit them and also delete them. 
The Board arranges these notes randomly, and initially i have arranged about 50 notes from the loremipsum API.

3. Component Reuse
4. Node npm server hosting
5. Basics of the React Library with initial rendering methods
